# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description
This project is an implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game to be played in the browser console. In future lessons, a Graphical User Interface will be added for a more interactive experience.

This was in TheOdinProject course. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

## How to Play
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the game.
3. You will be prompted to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for each of the 5 rounds.
4. After the 5 rounds, check the browser console (DevTools) to see the results of the game.

*Note: For a more interactive experience, a Graphical User Interface will be added in future lessons.*

## Code Structure
The code for this project is organized into the following main files:

- **index.html:** This file contains the HTML structure for the game. Currently, the game is played in the browser console, so this file sets up the basic HTML document.

- **script.js:** The JavaScript code for the game logic is written in this file. It handles user input, game mechanics, and displays results in the console.

*Note: A CSS file will be added in a later lesson to enhance the visual presentation of the game.*

## Future Plans
In upcoming lessons, a Graphical User Interface will be added. Stay tuned for updates!
