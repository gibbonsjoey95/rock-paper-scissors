# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description
This project is an implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game to be played in the browser console. In future lessons, a Graphical User Interface will be added for a more interactive experience.

## How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps in the browser console:
1. Open your browser console.
2. Copy and paste the game code into the console.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
4. See the result of the game in the console.

## Code Structure
The code for this project is organized into the following main files:

- **index.html:** This file contains the HTML structure for the game. Currently, the game is played in the browser console, so this file sets up the basic HTML document.

- **script.js:** The JavaScript code for the game logic is written in this file. It handles user input, game mechanics, and displays results in the console.

*Note: A CSS file will be added in a later lesson to enhance the visual presentation of the game.*

## Future Plans
In upcoming lessons, a Graphical User Interface will be added. Stay tuned for updates!
