 # Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description
This project is an implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game. Initially played in the browser console, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been added for a more interactive experience.
This project was presented by theodinproject.com https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors



## How to Play
1. Visit the game [here](https://gibbons-rps.netlify.app/).
2. The screen will prompt you to make your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. Click on the corresponding button to make your choice.
4. The game will determine the winner of the round.
5. The first player to reach 5 wins is the overall series winner.

## How Ties Are Handled
In case of a tie, neither the player nor the computer receives a point. The game prompts the player to make another choice, and the game continues until a clear winner is determined.

## Code Structure
The code for this project is organized into the following main files:

- **index.html:** This file contains the HTML structure for the game, including the GUI.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file adds basic styling to enhance the visual presentation of the game.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript code for the game logic is written in this file. It handles user input, game mechanics, and displays results.
